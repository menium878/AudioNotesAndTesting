Analog to digital conversion - taking the analog source coverted to numbers


What is a sound? Vibration waves

### Sampling Rate
Rate at which is sound is being sampled
44100/sec
time-> x axis
signal get sampled 44100 each sec

sampled -> hold (hold that value to next time point now its 1/44100s)


values between -1 and 1

### Bit depth
if i have the values between -1 and 1 i have 2^x of spaces between them where x is a bit depth value
### Quantization
Process of placing the value sampled closses to availble bit depth posssition
